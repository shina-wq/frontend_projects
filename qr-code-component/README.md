## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce the fundamentals of **HTML structure** and **CSS styling**. Some key takeaways:

- Using **Flexbox** to center the QR code component:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

- Styling the card with **rounded corners and shadows**:

```css
.card {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

- Ensuring a **responsive design** with relative units and media queries.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Improve my understanding of **CSS Grid**.
- Experiment with **CSS animations** for interactive UI components.
- Work on **accessibility** improvements by ensuring better contrast and screen-reader support.

### Useful Resources
